            <h1>Brighter</h1>
            <p>Brighter is a .NET implementation of the Command Processor pattern.</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0kUFZDuqvmEC&lpg=PA288&ots=MJzBAU9zGr&dq=posa%20command%20processor&pg=PA277#v=onepage&q&f=false">
            The command processor pattern separates the request for a service from its execution. A command processor component manages requests as separate objects,
                schedules their execution, and provides additional services such as the storing of request objects for later undo.
            </blockquote>
            <p>A command processor is often used with a Model-View-Controller architecture to avoid the <a href="FatController.html">Fat Controller</a> problem.
                It can act as the port layer in a <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">ports & adapters </a>architecture.</p>
            <p>A command processor provides loose coupling between the sender and the receiver. In addition to improving the modifiability quality attribute of the application
                - we can change the receiver without the sender knowing and the sender does not have to understand dependencies that the receiver needs to fulfill out the request
            - it also allows us to implement orthogonal operations such as logging, or scheduling without forcing the sender to be aware of them.</p>
