        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is Brighter?</h2>
        <p>Brighter is an implementation of the Command Dispatcher and Command Processor patterns. These allow you to decouple a endpoint,
            such as an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/modelViewController.html">MVC Input Controller</a> from the domain logic that handles the request. The intent
            is to support the Open-Closed Principle - open to extension, closed for modification - by allowing handlers to be replaced or added, without modifying the calling code;
            or for the endpoint framework to be replaced without impacting the domain code.</p>
        <p>Brighter is intended to be a library not a framework, so it is consciously lightweight and divided into packages that allow you to consume only those facilities that you need in your
            project.</p>
        <p>Brighter provides utility packages to help build quality of service into the handler pipeline, which can also serve as examples for your own pipelines.</p>
        <p>In addition, Brighter supports tasks queues: passing commands and events over an amqp broker, such as RabbitMQ, to be handle asynchronously by one or more event consumers.</p>
        <p> The intent of Brighter is to make the difference between synchronous and asynchronous handling as small as possible: both write the same handlers with the same steps in the sequence.
        On the producer side, sending asynchronously is just a different method on the dispatcher. On the consumer side a Service Activator library helps implement the endpoint code
            so that marshalling to an asynchronous handler is as friction-free a manner as possible.</p>
        <p>The latter functionality has similar goals to <em>NServiceBus</em>, <em>Mass Transit</em>, <em>Fubu Bus</em>, <em>Rebus</em> or <em>Celery</em></p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Bus, Processor or Dispatcher, what's in a name?</h2>
        <p>.NET projects that support task queues - pushing work onto a queue to be handled asynchronously by one or more consumers - tend to use the term BUS in their naming
        regardless of whether or not they are implemented using a Bus topology (i.e. publish subscribe, with no central message broker). Brighter tries to avoid this confusion by talking about
        Dispatcher, Processor, Service Activator patterns and a Broker architectural style instead</p>
