        <h1>Brighter</h1>
        <h2>Task Queues</h2>
       <p>Brighter provides support for a <a href="http://parlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/_media/patterns/taskqueue.pdf">distributed task queue</a>. Instead of handling a command or event, synchronously
           and in-process, work can be dispatched to a distributed task queue to be handled asynchronously and out-of-process. The trade-off here is between the cost of distribution
           (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">The Fallacies of Distributed Computing</a>) against performance.
           </p>
        <p>For example you might have an HTTP API a rule that any given request to that API must execute in under 100ms. On measuring the performance of a key POST or PUT operation to your API you find that
        you exceed this value. Upon realizing that much of your time is spent I/O you consider two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the TPL to perform the work concurrently</li>
            <li>Offload the work to a distributed task queue, ack the message, and allow the work to complete asynchronously</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A problem with the TPL approach is that your operation can only meet the 100ms threshold if your work can be parallelised such that no sub-task takes longer than 100ms. Your speed is always
            constrained by the slowest operation that you need to parallelize. If you are I/O bound on a resource experiencing contention beyond 100ms, you will not meet your goal by introducing
            more threads. Your minimum time is your minimum time.</p>
        <p>You might try to fix this by acking (acknowledging) the request, and completing the work asynchronously. This option is particularly attractive if the work is I/O bound as you can process other requests
            whilst you wait for the I/O to complete. </p>
        <p>The downside of the async approach is that you risk that the work will be lost if the server fails prior to completion of the work, or the app simply recycles.</p>
        <p>These requirements tend to push you in the direction of <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html">Guaranteed Delivery</a> to ensure that work you ack will eventually be handled.</p>
        <p>A distributed task queue allows you offload work to another process, to be handled asynchronously (once you push the work onto the queue, you don't wait) and in parallel (you can use other cores to process the work).
            It also allows you to ensure delivery of the message, eventually (the queue will hold the work until a consumer is available to read it).</p>
        <p>In addition use of a distributed task queue allows you to throttle requests - you can hand work off from the web server to a queue that only needs to consume at the
            rate you have resources to support. This allows you to scale to meet unexpected demand, at the price of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency.</a> </p>
        <h2>Brighter's Task Queue Architecture</h2>
        <p>Brighter implements Task Queues using a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageBroker.html">Message Broker</a>.</p>
        <p>The producer sends a <strong>Command</strong> or <strong>Event</strong> to a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageBroker.html">Message Broker</a>
            using <strong>CommandProcessor.Post()</strong>.</p>
        <p>We use an <strong>IAmAMessageMapper</strong> to map the <strong>Command</strong> or <strong>Event</strong> to a <strong>Message</strong>. (Usually we just serialize the object to JSON and add to the <strong>MessageBody</strong>),
            but if you want to use higher performance serialization approaches, such as <a href="https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net">protobuf-net</a>, the message mapper is agnostic to the way the body is formatted.)</p>
        <p>When we deserialize we set the <strong>MessageHeader</strong> which includes a topic (often we use a namespaced name for the <strong>Command</strong> or <strong>Event</strong>).</p>
        <p>We store the created <strong>Message</strong> in a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageStore.html">Message Store</a> for use by
                <strong>CommandProcessor.Repost()</strong> if we need to resend a failed message.</p>
        <p>The Message Broker manages a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/RecipientList.html">Recipient List</a> of subscribers to a topic. When it receives a <strong>Message</strong>
            the Broker looks at the topic in the <strong>MessageHeader</strong> and dispatches the <strong>Message</strong> to the
            <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html">Recipient Channels</a> identified by the Recipient List.</p>
        <p>The consumer registers a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html">Recipient Channel</a>
            to receive messages on a given topic. In other words when the consumer's registered topic matches the producer's topic, the broker dispatches the message to the consumer when it receives it from the producer.</p>
          <p>A <strong>Message</strong> may be delivered to multiple Consumers, all of whom get their own copy.</p>
        <p>in addition, we can support a <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html">Competing Consumers</a> approach by having multiple consumers read
            from the same <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html">Channel</a> to allow us to scale out to meet load.</p>

        <h2>Do I have to use a Broker, what about MSMQ?</h2>
        <p>Brighter removes some complexity from its implementation by relying on the Message Broker to provide a number of services. First the Broker provides message routing. The producer does not need to have any idea
            where the consumers are located, only where the broker is located. This makes it easy to relocate your consumers, and when then begin subscribing the Broker will figure out how to deliver to them. It also supports
            a recipient list when routing messages: one producer can send to many consumers. Second we rely on the Broker to provide a clustered High Availability (HA) solution to queueing. We want to be able to send a
            message to the Broker cluster and rely on the Broker to deliver it, eventually.</p>
        <p>Without a Broker, using a point-ot-point solution we have to provide a lot of this infrastructure ourselves, such as routing and distribution and how to do so in a way that is HA.</p>
        <p>For this reason we don't support a point-to-point approach like MSMQ or sending directly to a service via HTTP. (We do have an experimental implementation of an HTTP-based broker using the RESTMS specification
            but it is not production-grade).</p>
        <h2>What happens when the consumer receives the message?</h2>
        <p>A consumer reads the <strong>Message</strong> using the <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessagingAdapter.html">Service Activator</a> pattern to map between an
             <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/EventDrivenConsumer.html">Event Driven Consumer</a> and a Handler.</p>
        <p>The use of the Service Activator pattern means the complexity of the distributed task queue is hidden from you. You just write a handler as normal, but call it via post and create a message mapper,
              the result is that your command is handled reliably, asynchronously, and in parallel with little cognitive overhead. It just works!</p>
        <h2>What does this look like in code</h2>
        <p>Instead of using <strong>CommandProcessor.Send()</strong> you use <strong>CommandProcessor.Post()</strong> to send the message</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                var reminderCommand = new TaskReminderCommand(
                     taskName: reminder.TaskName,
                     dueDate: DateTime.Parse(reminder.DueDate),
                     recipient: reminder.Recipient,
                     copyTo: reminder.CopyTo
                     );

                 _commandProcessor.Post(reminderCommand);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>You add a message mapper to tell Brighter how to serialize the message for sending to your consumers.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                
            </code>
